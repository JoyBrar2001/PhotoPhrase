# PhotoPhrase - Image to Caption Generator

PhotoPhrase is a web application that generates captions for uploaded images using advanced computer vision and natural language processing techniques. The frontend is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui, while the backend utilizes Python, VGG16 for feature extraction, and neural networks connected through a custom API.

## Features

- **Intuitive User Interface**: The website features a clean and modern design, making it easy for users to upload images and receive their captions.
- **Powerful Image Caption Generation**: Leveraging the VGG16 convolutional neural network for feature extraction and a custom neural network model, PhotoPhrase accurately generates captions that describe the contents of the uploaded images.
- **Real-Time Processing**: The custom API allows for seamless integration between the frontend and backend, enabling real-time image processing and caption generation.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is built with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered and static websites with excellent performance and developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a highly customizable and responsive styling solution.
- **Shadcn/ui**: A set of accessible and modern React UI components, built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI libraries.

### Backend

- **Python**: The backend is built using Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
- **VGG16**: A pre-trained convolutional neural network model used for feature extraction from the uploaded images.
- **Neural Networks**: A custom neural network model trained on image caption data for generating accurate and descriptive captions.
- **Custom API**: A Flask or Django-based API that integrates the frontend and backend components, enabling real-time image processing and caption generation.
